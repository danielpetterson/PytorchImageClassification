# Pytorch Image Classification

The dataset used in this project is an image classification dataset, which consists of a total of 6,000 RGB images across 3 classes, with 2,000 images per class. The 3 classes are tomato, cherry, and strawberry. The three classes of images have been manually made to be completely mutually exclusive, i.e. each image belongs to only one class.
